# Platform Changes: Removal of Promo Code System

## Summary of Changes

The platform has been updated to remove the promo code activation system. Now, **all courses are automatically available to users after registration**. This simplifies the user experience and eliminates the need for promo codes to access course content.

## Key Changes

   - When a user registers, all available courses are automatically added to their account
   - No promo codes are required to access any content

2. **Course Access**:
   - All authenticated users can access any course's full content
   - The locked course UI has been removed
   - No more prompts for promo code entry

3. **Removed Components**:
   - PromoCodeForm component
   - EmergencyFix component
   - All emergency access endpoints
   - Promo code database model
   - Direct access middleware

4. **Database Changes**:
   - Removed `promoCode` field from User model
   - Removed PromoCode collection entirely
   - Kept `activatedCourses` field for backward compatibility

## Technical Details
